# Semantic Graph Implementation Status

This document describes the current implementation status of the semantic graph in GraphAlchemy, clarifying what has been implemented versus what remains on the roadmap.

## Currently Implemented

### Core Graph Components

1. **Nodes**:
   - `Tenant`: Top-level organization of schemas
   - `Dataset`: Collections of related tables
   - `Table`: Database tables with metadata
   - `Column`: Database columns with metadata
   - `BusinessGlossary`: Container for business terms
   - `GlossaryTerm`: Individual business terms with definitions
   - `BusinessMetric`: Business calculation definitions

2. **Relationships**:
   - `OWNS`: Tenant to Dataset relationship
   - `CONTAINS`: Dataset to Table relationship
   - `HAS_COLUMN`: Table to Column relationship
   - `LIKELY_REFERENCES`: Column to Column relationship (foreign keys)
   - `HAS_TERM`: BusinessGlossary to GlossaryTerm relationship
   - `MAPS_TO`: GlossaryTerm to Table/Column mappings
   - `HAS_METRIC`: BusinessGlossary to BusinessMetric relationship

3. **Properties**:
   - Relationship confidence scores
   - Usage statistics
   - Mapping weights
   - Rich metadata on all nodes

### Schema Extraction & Storage

1. **Schema Loaders**:
   - BigQuery schema extraction
   - DDL-based schema parsing
   - Simulation-based schema generation

2. **Relationship Inference**:
   - Name pattern matching (e.g., customer_id -> customers.id)
   - Statistical overlap analysis 
   - Weighted relationship scoring

3. **Term Mapping**:
   - Glossary term to schema entity mapping
   - Weight adjustment based on usage
   - Confidence scoring

### Query Resolution

1. **Entity Resolution**:
   - Direct matching to tables/columns
   - Glossary term-based resolution 
   - Weighted term mapping with confidence scoring

2. **Runtime Composite Concept Handling**:
   - Detection of multi-word concepts from individual terms
   - Dynamic combination of business terms during query processing
   - Concept resolution using context and glossary terms

3. **Join Path Discovery**:
   - Multiple join path discovery strategies
   - Path ranking based on confidence, weight, and usage
   - Specialized algorithms for optimal path finding

## Not Yet Implemented

1. **Composite Concept Nodes**: 
   - The documentation mentions `CompositeConcept` nodes, but these are not yet implemented as persistent entities in the graph
   - Currently, composite concepts are handled dynamically during query resolution
   - No dedicated storage or retrieval mechanisms exist for composite concepts

2. **Concept Harvesting**:
   - Automated identification of composite concepts from query patterns
   - Persistent storage of identified composite concepts
   - User interfaces for managing composite concepts

## Implementation Roadmap for Composite Concepts

To implement `CompositeConcept` nodes as described in the documentation:

1. **Schema Extension**:
   - Add `CompositeConcept` label in Neo4j schema
   - Define relationships to component terms and entities
   - Create schema constraints and indices

2. **API Extension**:
   - Add methods to `neo4j_client.py` for CRUD operations:
     - `create_composite_concept()`
     - `get_composite_concept()`
     - `update_composite_concept()`
     - `get_composite_concepts_for_tenant()`

3. **Harvesting Methods**:
   - Query pattern analysis to identify frequently co-occurring terms
   - LLM-based suggestion of industry-specific composite concepts
   - User feedback collection for concept refinement
   - Runtime tracking of concept combinations that lead to successful queries

4. **Resolution Integration**:
   - Update `query_resolution.py` to first check for persistent composite concepts
   - Fall back to runtime detection only when needed
   - Add caching of frequently used composite concepts

## Current Semantic Graph Workflow

The current implementation follows this workflow:

1. **Schema Extraction**: Extract schema metadata from sources into the graph
2. **Relationship Inference**: Discover and store relationships between entities
3. **Business Glossary Creation**: Generate and store business glossary terms
4. **Term Mapping**: Connect business terms to technical entities
5. **Query Resolution**: 
   - Identify entities mentioned in natural language
   - Resolve to actual tables/columns/metrics
   - Perform runtime composite concept detection when needed
   - Find optimal join paths between entities
   - Generate SQL based on resolved entities and relationships

## Accuracy Note

This document reflects the actual implementation status as of the current code review. Any features described in other documentation but not listed as implemented here should be considered part of the future roadmap rather than existing functionality.
