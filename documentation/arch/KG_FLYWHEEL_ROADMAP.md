### Step 2: Relationship-Enriched Column Descriptions âœ…

- [x] Implemented `ColumnRelationshipProvider` to extract relationship context for columns
- [x] Enhanced column description prompts to leverage relationship information
- [x] Added directionality awareness (outgoing vs. incoming references)
- [x] Added role classification (primary key, foreign key, or both)
- [x] Created test script for `ColumnRelationshipProvider`
- [x] Created comparative test to demonstrate improvement in description quality
- [x] Integrated with `DirectEnhancementWorkflow` for column description enhancement

## In Progress

### Step 3: Graph-Aware Business Glossary ðŸ”„

- [ ] Enhance business glossary generation with relationship graph awareness 
- [ ] Update business term relationship discovery to leverage existing data relationships
- [ ] Improve mapping between business terms and technical elements using relationship information
- [ ] Create test scripts for evaluating business glossary enhancement

## Future Work

### Step 4: Business Term to SQL Translation Enhancement

- [ ] Leverage knowledge graph for better mapping between natural language and SQL elements
- [ ] Improve join path selection using relationship confidence scores
- [ ] Enhance query plan generation with relationship-aware optimization

### Step 5: Feedback Loop Implementation

- [ ] Track usage patterns of relationships in generated SQL
- [ ] Update relationship weights based on usage frequency
- [ ] Implement confidence calibration based on query success

### Step 6: End-to-End Evaluation

- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for KG Flywheel benefits
- [ ] Measure impact on SQL generation accuracy
- [ ] Benchmark performance improvements

## Metrics for Success

1. **Description Quality**: Measured through both automated metrics and human evaluation
2. **SQL Generation Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly generated SQL queries
3. **Join Path Accuracy**: Correctness of join paths in complex multi-table queries
4. **System Understanding**: Improvement in business term translation accuracy
5. **Performance**: Speed and resource utilization of the enhanced system
