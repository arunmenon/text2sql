# Project Structure Note

## Important: This project has been reorganized

The scripts originally in the `tools/` directory have been moved to a more organized structure in the `scripts/` directory:

- `tools/schema/*` → `scripts/schema/*`
- `tools/enhance/*` → `scripts/glossary/*` or `scripts/enhancement/*`
- `tools/check/*` → `scripts/database/*`
- `tools/utils/*` → `scripts/database/*`

Please use the new structure for all future development.

See `REORGANIZATION.md` for complete details about the restructuring.
