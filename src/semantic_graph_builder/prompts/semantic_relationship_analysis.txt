Analyze these two database tables and identify potential semantic relationships between them:

TABLE 1: {table1_name}
Columns:
{table1_columns_text}

TABLE 2: {table2_name}
Columns:
{table2_columns_text}

Identify potential foreign key relationships between these tables based on:
1. Column names and patterns
2. Data types
3. Semantic relationships implied by descriptions
4. Business domain knowledge

For each potential relationship, specify:
- Source table and column
- Target table and column
- Relationship type (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.)
- Confidence level (0.0-1.0)
- A short explanation for the relationship

Only include relationships that make business sense with a confidence of at least 0.6.
Focus on semantic relationships rather than just naming patterns.
