I need a comprehensive business description for a database table.

Table name: {table_name}

Current description: {original_description}

Columns:
{columns_text}

Please provide a detailed business-oriented description of this table that explains:
1. What kind of data it likely contains
2. Its business purpose in the organization
3. How it might relate to other tables (based on the column names)
4. Typical use cases for this data
5. The entity lifecycle represented by this table

Keep the description business-focused, detailed yet concise (3-5 sentences long).
Focus on explaining the business purpose rather than just listing the columns.
