I need detailed descriptions for these columns in the table '{table_name}'.

Columns needing descriptions:
{columns_to_enhance_text}

All columns in this table (for context):
{all_columns_text}

For each column that needs a description, provide:
1. A clear description of what the column represents
2. Its business purpose and how it's used
3. Any data constraints or rules that might apply
4. Potential relationships or joins to other tables

Respond with structured data for each column, focusing on business meaning rather than technical details.
