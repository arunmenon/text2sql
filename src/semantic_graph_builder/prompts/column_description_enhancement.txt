I need detailed descriptions for these columns in the table '{table_name}'.

Columns needing descriptions:
{columns_to_enhance_text}

All columns in this table (for context):
{all_columns_text}

{sample_data}

{column_examples}

For each column that needs a description, provide:
1. A clear description of what the column represents, based on the actual data values shown
2. Its business purpose and how it's used
3. Any data constraints or rules that might apply (derived from the sample values)
4. Potential relationships or joins to other tables
5. Data patterns or formats observed in the sample values

Respond with structured data for each column, focusing on business meaning rather than technical details.
Ground your descriptions in the actual data examples when available.
