Analyze the following two database tables and identify potential relationships between them.

Source Table: {source_table_name}
Description: {source_table_description}
Columns:
{source_columns}

{source_sample_data}

Target Table: {target_table_name}
Description: {target_table_description}
Columns:
{target_columns}

{target_sample_data}

{data_overlap_analysis}

Based on the table and column names, data types, descriptions, and sample data, identify potential foreign key relationships.
Consider standard database naming conventions, semantic relationships, and business logic.

Focus on these types of relationships:
1. Primary key to foreign key (e.g., customers.id → orders.customer_id)
2. Lookup relationships (e.g., products.category_code → categories.code)
3. Association/junction table relationships (for many-to-many)

For each potential relationship:
1. Specify the source and target tables and columns
2. Indicate relationship type (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
3. Assign a confidence score (0.0-1.0)
4. Provide a detailed explanation for why you believe this relationship exists
   - Include specific evidence from column names, data types, and sample data
   - Explain the business meaning of this relationship
   - Note any patterns or anomalies in the data that support your conclusion

Only return relationships with meaningful business value. Ignore implementation details like created_at/updated_at columns.
