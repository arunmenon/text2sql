# Business Glossary Term Generation

## Database Schema:
{formatted_schema}

## Instructions:
Generate a comprehensive business glossary by analyzing this database schema.

For each business term:
1. FIRST identify tables and columns that represent business concepts
2. THEN think about what these elements mean in business language
3. FINALLY create clear, concise definitions

## Expected Output Format:
For each term provide:
- Term name (using business language, not technical terms)
- Definition (1-2 sentences explaining the concept)
- Technical mapping (which table/column this maps to)
- Synonyms (alternative ways this term might be referred to)

## Examples:
| Term | Definition | Technical Mapping | Synonyms |
|------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| Customer | A person or organization that has purchased products | customers table | Client, Buyer, Account |
| Order Status | The current state of a customer order | orders.status column | Order State, Fulfillment Status |

Think carefully about each table and its business purpose.
