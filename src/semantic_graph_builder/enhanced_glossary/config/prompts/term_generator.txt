# Business Glossary Term Generation

## Database Schema:
{formatted_schema}

## Instructions:
Generate a comprehensive business glossary by analyzing this database schema and sample data.

For each business term:
1. FIRST identify tables and columns that represent business concepts
2. THEN analyze the sample data values to understand what the data actually represents
3. NEXT think about what these elements mean in business language
4. FINALLY create clear, concise definitions grounded in the actual data

## Important - Using Sample Data:
- Look at the sample data provided for each table to understand the actual content
- Use the real column values in the examples to determine the meaning and purpose
- Base your definitions on actual data patterns rather than just column names
- Pay attention to value formats, ranges, and patterns in the sample data

## Expected Output Format:
For each term provide:
- Term name (using business language, not technical terms)
- Definition (1-2 sentences explaining the concept, referencing actual data formats if relevant)
- Technical mapping (which table/column this maps to)
- Synonyms (alternative ways this term might be referred to)

## Examples:
| Term | Definition | Technical Mapping | Synonyms |
|------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| Customer | A person or organization that has purchased products (identified by unique IDs like 'CUST-1234') | customers table | Client, Buyer, Account |
| Order Status | The current state of a customer order, with values such as 'Processing', 'Shipped', or 'Delivered' | orders.status column | Order State, Fulfillment Status |

Think carefully about each table, its sample data, and its business purpose.
Your glossary terms should be firmly grounded in the actual data examples.
