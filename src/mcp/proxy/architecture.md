# MCP Proxy Architecture

This document outlines the architecture for a flexible MCP proxy that can expose multiple services to Claude.

## Overview

The MCP Proxy serves as a bridge between Claude and your various services (Neo4j, future APIs, etc.). It handles the MCP protocol requirements while allowing you to easily plug in new services.

## Components

### 1. Core MCP Server

- Implements the MCP protocol via the official SDK
- Handles initialization, tool discovery, and proper JSON-RPC formatting
- Routes requests to appropriate service adapters

### 2. Service Registry

- Maintains a registry of available services
- Dynamically loads services based on configuration
- Handles service discovery and resource aggregation

### 3. Service Adapters

- Each service gets its own adapter class
- Translates MCP operations to service-specific API calls
- Handles response formatting and error management

### 4. Configuration Management

- External configuration file defines available services
- Service-specific connection details and parameters
- Environment variable support for sensitive credentials

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Structure and Neo4j Integration

- Create the core proxy structure
- Implement the Neo4j adapter
- Set up configuration management

### Phase 2: Pluggable Service Architecture

- Create the service registry mechanism
- Implement dynamic loading of services
- Add service lifecycle management

### Phase 3: Additional Service Adapters

- Add adapters for additional services as needed
- Implement cross-service operations
- Create monitoring and logging capabilities

## Extensibility

This architecture allows you to:

1. Add new services by simply creating a new adapter class
2. Update the configuration to register the new service
3. Use standardized integrations with Claude

All without changing the core proxy code or existing adapters.
