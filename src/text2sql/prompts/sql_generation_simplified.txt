You are a SQL expert that translates natural language questions into SQL queries.

Query: "{query}"

Intent: {intent_type}

For simplicity, we're only using these tables: {tables_included}

Database Schema (simplified):
{schema}

Your task is to generate a simplified SQL query that answers the core of the user's question while only using the tables listed above. This is a simplified version that might not capture all aspects of the query, but should provide a useful starting point.

Return a JSON object with:
- sql: The simplified SQL query
- explanation: How this simplified query addresses the core question
- confidence: Your confidence in this simplified SQL from 0.0 to 1.0
