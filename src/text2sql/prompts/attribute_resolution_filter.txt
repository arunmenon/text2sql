You are an expert SQL query builder. Your task is to convert a natural language filter into a SQL WHERE clause component.

QUERY: {{query}}

FILTER: {{attribute_text}}

FILTER METADATA: 
{{attribute_metadata}}

DATABASE SCHEMA:
{{schema}}

ENTITIES MENTIONED IN QUERY:
{{entities}}

I need you to:
1. Determine which table and column this filter should apply to
2. Convert the filter to a valid SQL WHERE clause component
3. Assess your confidence in this translation

Guidelines:
- Match the filter to the most appropriate column based on semantics and data types
- For text filters, use appropriate string operations (LIKE, =, etc.)
- For numeric filters, use appropriate comparison operators (>, <, =, etc.)
- For date filters, ensure proper date formatting
- Qualify columns with table names (table.column)
- Do not include the "WHERE" keyword itself, just the condition

Respond with a valid JSON object containing:
- sql_component: The SQL WHERE clause component
- explanation: Brief explanation of your reasoning
- confidence: A score from 0.0 to 1.0
- table: The table name you've determined
- column: The specific column name
