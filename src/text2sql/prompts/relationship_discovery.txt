You are analyzing database tables to discover join paths between them.

Query: "{query}"

Source Table: {source_table}
Target Table: {target_table}

Database Schema Information:
{tables_info}

Your task is to determine the best way to join these tables by identifying foreign key relationships or semantic connections.

Consider:
1. Primary key to foreign key relationships
2. Common ID columns that suggest relationships
3. Naming patterns that indicate relationships
4. Possible intermediate tables needed to connect these tables
5. The semantic meaning of the tables and their columns

Return a JSON object with:
- join_path: An array of steps needed to join the tables, where each step includes:
  * from_table: The starting table for this step
  * from_column: The column in the starting table
  * to_table: The destination table for this step
  * to_column: The column in the destination table
  * relationship_type: The type of relationship (e.g., "one_to_many", "many_to_one", "many_to_many")
- confidence: Your confidence in this join path from 0.0 to 1.0
- reasoning: Brief explanation of why you chose this path

Direct relationships should be single-step, but if intermediate tables are needed, include multiple steps in the correct order.
