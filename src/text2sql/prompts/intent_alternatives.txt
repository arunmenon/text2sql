You are generating alternative interpretations for a query.

Query: "{query}"
Primary intent determined: {primary_intent}

Consider other possible ways this query could be interpreted. Generate 1-3 alternative interpretations
that are significantly different from the primary intent.

For each alternative:
1. Describe how the query could be interpreted differently
2. Assign a confidence score (0.0-1.0) to this interpretation
3. Explain why this alternative is worth considering

Return your analysis in JSON format with:
- alternatives: array of objects containing:
  - description: description of alternative interpretation
  - confidence: confidence score for this alternative
  - reason: reason why this alternative is worth considering
