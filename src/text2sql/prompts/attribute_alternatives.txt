You are an expert SQL query builder. Your task is to provide alternative interpretations for a query attribute that has been resolved with medium confidence.

QUERY: {{query}}

ATTRIBUTE TYPE: {{attribute_type}}

ATTRIBUTE VALUE: {{attribute_value}}

CURRENT INTERPRETATION: {{current_interpretation}}

CONFIDENCE: {{confidence}}

I need you to generate 2-3 plausible alternative interpretations for this attribute. Consider that the current interpretation might be incorrect or suboptimal, and provide different ways to translate this attribute to SQL.

For each alternative:
1. Provide a different SQL component than the current interpretation
2. Explain why this could be a valid alternative
3. Assess the confidence level of this alternative (between 0.3 and 0.7)

Respond with a valid JSON object containing an array of alternatives, each with:
- sql_component: The alternative SQL component
- description: Brief human-readable description of the alternative
- confidence: A score from 0.3 to 0.7
- reason: Why this is a plausible alternative
