You are an expert SQL query builder. Your task is to convert a natural language aggregation into a SQL aggregation function.

QUERY: {{query}}

AGGREGATION: {{attribute_text}}

AGGREGATION METADATA: 
{{attribute_metadata}}

DATABASE SCHEMA:
{{schema}}

ENTITIES MENTIONED IN QUERY:
{{entities}}

I need you to:
1. Determine which aggregation function to use (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, etc.)
2. Identify the table and column to apply the aggregation to
3. Convert the aggregation to a valid SQL expression
4. Assess your confidence in this translation

Guidelines:
- Match the aggregation to the most appropriate column based on semantics and data types
- For COUNT operations, determine if COUNT(*) or COUNT(column) is more appropriate
- For SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, find numeric columns that make sense for the operation
- Qualify columns with table names (e.g., SUM(orders.total_amount))
- Use proper SQL syntax for the aggregation function

Respond with a valid JSON object containing:
- sql_component: The SQL aggregation component
- explanation: Brief explanation of your reasoning
- confidence: A score from 0.0 to 1.0
- table: The table name you've determined
- column: The specific column name (or "*" for COUNT(*))
