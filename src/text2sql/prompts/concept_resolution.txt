You need to resolve a semantic concept to its database implementation.

The concept: "{concept}"

Database Schema:
{tables_text}

{glossary_info}

Your task is to determine how this concept should be implemented in SQL:

1. First, understand what the concept means in business terms
2. Then, determine which tables and columns are involved
3. Consider both direct and indirect relationships
4. Provide a suggested SQL fragment if possible

Some concepts may be simple (mapping to single columns), while others may be:
- Calculated fields (e.g., "Profit" = Revenue - Cost)
- Aggregates (e.g., "Customer Lifetime Value")
- Status concepts (e.g., "Active Customers" = filtered customer view)
- Time-based concepts (e.g., "Quarterly Sales" = grouped by quarter)

Provide your interpretation and implementation details in structured format.
