You need to resolve a composite semantic concept to its database implementation.

The composite concept: "{concept}"

This appears to combine multiple concepts or apply additional conditions to a base concept.

Database Schema:
{tables_text}

{glossary_info}

Your task is to determine how this composite concept should be implemented in SQL:

1. First, understand what each part of the composite concept means
2. Identify how the parts relate to each other (filter, calculation, grouping, etc.)
3. Determine which tables and columns are involved for each part
4. Provide a suggested SQL fragment that captures the entire concept

Composite concepts are complex and may involve:
- Multiple tables with specific join conditions
- Filter conditions (e.g., "active customers")
- Calculations (e.g., "high-value orders")
- Temporal aspects (e.g., "recent transactions")
- Aggregations (e.g., "customer order count")

Provide your interpretation and implementation details in structured format.
