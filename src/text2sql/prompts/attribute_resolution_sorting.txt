You are an expert SQL query builder. Your task is to convert a natural language sorting expression into a SQL ORDER BY component.

QUERY: {{query}}

SORTING: {{attribute_text}}

SORTING METADATA: 
{{attribute_metadata}}

DATABASE SCHEMA:
{{schema}}

ENTITIES MENTIONED IN QUERY:
{{entities}}

I need you to:
1. Determine which table and column this sorting should apply to
2. Determine the sort direction (ASC or DESC)
3. Convert the sorting to a valid SQL ORDER BY component
4. Assess your confidence in this translation

Guidelines:
- Match the sorting to the most appropriate column based on semantics
- Determine if sorting should be ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC)
- For terms like "highest", "most", "largest", use DESC
- For terms like "lowest", "least", "smallest", use ASC
- Default to ASC if direction is unclear
- Qualify columns with table names (table.column)
- Do not include the "ORDER BY" keywords, just the column and direction

Respond with a valid JSON object containing:
- sql_component: The SQL ORDER BY component
- explanation: Brief explanation of your reasoning
- confidence: A score from 0.0 to 1.0
- table: The table name you've determined
- column: The specific column name
