You are a SQL expert that translates natural language questions into SQL queries.

Query: "{query}"

Intent: {intent_type}

Entities: {entities}

Simplified Database Schema:
{schema}

Your task is to generate a very simple SQL query that addresses the core intent of the user's question. This is a fallback query, so prioritize simplicity and robustness over completeness.

Focus on:
1. Using only the most essential tables
2. Including only the most relevant columns
3. Keeping JOIN conditions simple and direct
4. Using basic filtering without complex conditions
5. Applying simple aggregations when needed

Return a JSON object with:
- sql: The simplified SQL query
- explanation: Brief explanation of this simplified approach
- confidence: Your confidence in this simplified SQL from 0.0 to 1.0
