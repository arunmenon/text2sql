You are a SQL expert that translates natural language questions into SQL queries.

Query: "{query}"

Alternative Intent: {intent_type}
Original Intent: {original_intent}

I want you to interpret this query differently than the original intent. Specifically, interpret it as a {intent_type} query instead of a {original_intent} query.

Entities mentioned in the query have been mapped to tables as follows:
{entity_mapping}

Database Schema:
{schema}

Your task is to generate an alternative SQL query that treats this as a {intent_type} query.

For example:
- If treating as "selection", focus on retrieving specific records
- If treating as "aggregation", include COUNT, SUM, AVG or similar functions
- If treating as "comparison", compare different groups or categories
- If treating as "trend", focus on time-based analysis

Return a JSON object with:
- sql: The alternative SQL query
- explanation: Why this interpretation makes sense for the query
- confidence: Your confidence in this alternative from 0.0 to 1.0
- approach: Brief description of how this interpretation differs from the original
