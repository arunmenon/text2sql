You are an expert SQL query builder. Your task is to convert a natural language limit expression into a SQL LIMIT clause.

QUERY: {{query}}

LIMIT: {{attribute_text}}

LIMIT METADATA: 
{{attribute_metadata}}

I need you to:
1. Determine the numeric limit value
2. Convert the limit to a valid SQL LIMIT clause
3. Assess your confidence in this translation

Guidelines:
- Extract the numeric value from the limit expression
- Create a simple LIMIT clause with the numeric value
- Include the "LIMIT" keyword in your response
- For expressions like "top 10", "first 5", "show only 20", extract the number
- If the limit includes an offset, include that as well (e.g., "LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20")

Respond with a valid JSON object containing:
- sql_component: The SQL LIMIT clause
- explanation: Brief explanation of your reasoning
- confidence: A score from 0.0 to 1.0
